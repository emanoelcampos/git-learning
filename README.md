# Learning Git by Building an SQL Reference Object

This document serves as a summary of my learning journey through the "Learn Git by Building an SQL Reference Object" course, part of the [Relational Database](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/relational-database/) certification from freeCodeCamp.

## Git Commands Learned

Throughout the course, I learned and practiced various Git commands. Here are some of the key commands I used:

- `git init`: This command is used to initialize a new Git repository.
- `git add`: This command adds a file to the staging area in preparation for a commit.
- `git commit`: This command creates a new commit with the changes in the staging area. This is how Git tracks changes to our code.
- `git branch`: This command is used to create, list, rename, and delete branches.
- `git checkout`: This command is used to switch between different branches and commits.
- `git merge`: This command is used to merge changes from one branch into another.

## Learning Process

The course was structured around the `sql_reference.json` file, which contains commonly used SQL commands. The learning process involved creating new branches and making changes to this file, which allowed me to practice using Git commands in a practical context.

For example, I would create a new branch, make changes to the `sql_reference.json` file (such as adding new SQL commands), and then use Git commands to add, commit, and merge these changes. This hands-on approach helped me understand not just the syntax of Git commands, but also how they are used in a real-world coding workflow.

Overall, this course provided a comprehensive introduction to Git, and I feel confident in my ability to use Git for version control in my future projects.
